This a fork of the demo (microsservices) application [Sock Shop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo). This fork is intended to demonstrate the use o autoscaling in a microservice application as part of an activity of the cource [IF1007](https://github.com/IF1007/if1007).

To do so, we followed the tutorial [How to Use Kubernetes for Autoscaling](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-use-kubernetes-for-autoscaling) and run a local kubernetes cluster locally by using Minikube.
