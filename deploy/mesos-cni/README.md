# Deploy to Mesos using CNI

These scripts will install the microservices demo on Apache Mesos using the CNI plugin.

## Caveates
- This is using a prerelease version of Mesos 1.0.0
- Mesos only supports CNI from version 1.0.0+
- Mesos only supports CNI on the Mesos containerizer
- Weave DNS does not work with Weave CNI
- This was developed on AWS. May not work on other services.

Please this blog post about the new [mesos unified containerizer](http://winderresearch.com/2016/07/02/Overview-of-Mesos-New-Unified-Containerizer/) for more information.

## Prerequisites
- A working Mesos cluster (here is an example of [how to install mesos on AWS using terraform](https://github.com/philwinder/mesos-terraform))
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- curl

## Quick start

```
./mesos-cni.sh install
./mesos-cni.sh start
```

## Usage
